write the skeleton of a tinder clone in react native.
the implementation is minimal, without user control/log in, and do not need to access a remote server. 

supported features:

- these are all ancient people, so the user specify a `desired age`, it do not filter anyone, instead each person displays a `year`, indicating in what year are they that age, and a photo of that age is displayed. 
- swipe left/right to like/dislike (all persons locally stored)
- if swiped `like`, read the book authored by this person. during reading can always swipe right to dislike. (swipe left is `next page` and continue reading)
