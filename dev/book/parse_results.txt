TITLE: My Life in Full
AUTHOR: Indra Nooyi (born 1955)

  Chapter: Chapter 3
  Age: ~unknown
  Reasoning: The excerpt contains only publication, copyright, and Library-of-Congress cataloging data; it offers no biographical events, dates, or life-stage details from which to compute the author’s age at any specific moment.

  Chapter: Chapter 5
  Age: ~unknown
  Reasoning: The excerpt only shows the table of contents with broad life-phase headings (“Growing Up,” “Finding My Footing,” “The PepsiCo Years,” “Looking Ahead”). None of these sections are dated, and no specific events, ages, or years are mentioned, so the author’s age at any given point cannot be determined from this text alone.

TITLE: Iacocca
AUTHOR: Lee Iacocca (born 1924)

  Chapter: Chapter 2
  Age: ~59
  Reasoning: The excerpts are book-review blurbs for “Iacocca: An Autobiography,” first published in April 1984. 1984 – 1924 = 60, but the reviews appeared at or just before publication, so the events described (his rescue of Chrysler) were written up while he was still 59.

  Chapter: Chapter 4
  Age: ~60
  Reasoning: The copyright date on the memoir is 1984 and the author was born in 1924, so 1984 – 1924 = 60.

AGE RANGE: 59 - 60

FILE: My Life -- Clinton, Bill -- 1st ed_, New York, New York State, 2004 -- New York _ Alfred A_ Knopf, 2004_ -- 9780375414572 -- 16bcaa492b382f7cca46a2914de1426e -- Anna’s Archive.epub
TITLE: My Life
AUTHOR: Bill Clinton (born 1946)

  Chapter: Chapter 3
  Age: ~54
  Reasoning: The memoir opens with Clinton recalling that the goal-setting paperback he still owns is “now almost thirty years old.” He bought it “just out of law school,” i.e., in 1973 (Yale Law graduation). Thirty years after 1973 is 2003, so the prologue is being written c. 2003. Born August 19, 1946, he is 57 in 2003, but the memories he is narrating in the prologue were recorded “just out of law school” (age 26–27). The bulk of the chapter, however, is a retrospective told from the vantage of the ex-president who left office in January 2001; the vignette about receiving the 1946 letter “more than fifty-four years earlier” places the scene in late 2000/early 2001, when he was 54.

  Chapter: Chapter 4
  Age: ~unknown
  Reasoning: Clinton was born in 1946; the events described (kindergarten, breaking his leg jumping rope, seeing High Noon in 1951-52) all fall between 1950 and 1952, making him roughly 4 to 6 years old.

AGE RANGE: 54 - 54

TITLE: Billions & Billions: Thoughts on Life and Death at the Brink of the Millennium
AUTHOR: Carl Sagan (born 1934)

  Chapter: Chapter 3
  Age: ~unknown
  Reasoning: The excerpt contains no personal events, dates, or life-stage markers—only a reflective quotation about mathematics—so the author’s age at the time cannot be estimated.

FILE: Personal Memoirs of U_ S_ Grant, Complete -- Ulysses S_ Grant [Grant, Ulysses S_] -- 2009 -- ed924662327c79f3945fea3b64dc3810 -- Anna’s Archive.epub
TITLE: Personal Memoirs of U. S. Grant, Complete
AUTHOR: Ulysses S. Grant (born 1822)

  Chapter: Chapter 2
  Age: ~unknown
  Reasoning: The excerpt contains only the title and index header of the memoir; no events, dates, or life-stage clues are provided from which to estimate the author’s age.

  Chapter: Chapter 3
  Age: ~43
  Reasoning: The excerpt describes events that occur immediately after the surrender of Confederate forces in April 1865. Grant was born in 1822, so 1865 – 1822 = 43 years old.

  Chapter: Chapter 4
  Age: ~42
  Reasoning: The excerpt is a continuous dispatch covering operations from mid-1864 (battles around Winchester in September, Petersburg/Richmond actions through October, Sherman’s Atlanta campaign and subsequent movements that autumn). Grant was born in 1822; 1864 – 1822 = 42 years old.

AGE RANGE: 42 - 43
